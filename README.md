# bbdc

## How to download

Clone the repository to your local machine

'''shell
git clone https://github.com/malexandrovs/bbdc
'''

This repository does not contain the training and test data for the bbdc challange. You have to copy the data into the main repository directory just the way it is given by the bbdc. In other words copy the directories "train" and "test" into your local repository. DO NOT add them to your git repository otherwise the push will not work because of the size.
